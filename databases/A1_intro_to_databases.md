# Module A1: Foundations - Understanding Databases


## What is a Database?

A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. It is controlled by a Database Management System (DBMS). Together, the data and the DBMS, along with the applications that are associated with them, are referred to as a database system, often shortened to just database.


## Why Do We Need Databases?

Applications need to store and retrieve data. While simple applications might use files (like CSVs or JSON files), this approach doesn't scale well and lacks many essential features for robust applications. Databases provide solutions for:

1.  **Persistence:**
    Data stored in a database outlives the process that created it. If your application restarts or the server reboots, the data remains.

2.  **Concurrency:**
    Databases are designed to allow multiple users or processes to access and modify data simultaneously without interfering with each other or corrupting the data (e.g., through locking mechanisms and transactions).

3.  **Integrity:**
    Databases can enforce rules (constraints) to ensure data is accurate, consistent, and reliable. For example, ensuring a user ID is unique or that a product price is always positive.

4.  **Scalability:**
    Databases are designed to handle large amounts of data and high volumes of requests efficiently. They can often be scaled up (more powerful server) or scaled out (distributed across multiple servers).

5.  **Data Management and Querying:**
    Databases provide powerful query languages (like SQL) to retrieve, filter, sort, and aggregate data in complex ways.

6.  **Security:**
    DBMSs offer mechanisms for controlling access to data, ensuring that only authorized users can view or modify specific information.

7.  **Backup and Recovery:**
    Databases typically include utilities for backing up data and recovering it in case of system failures.


## Overview of Database Categories

Databases can be broadly classified into two main categories: Relational (SQL) and Non-Relational (NoSQL).

### 1. Relational Databases (SQL)

-   Pronounced "S-Q-L" or sometimes "See-Quel".
-   **Structure:** Data is organized into tables (relations), which consist of rows (records or tuples) and columns (attributes or fields). Each table has a predefined schema that dictates the data type and constraints for each column.
-   **Relationships:** Tables can be related to each other using foreign keys, allowing for complex data models and reducing data redundancy.
-   **Query Language:** Primarily use Structured Query Language (SQL) for defining and manipulating the data.
-   **ACID Properties:** Relational databases are known for adhering to ACID properties, which guarantee reliable transaction processing:
    *   **Atomicity:** Transactions are all-or-nothing. If one part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction fails, and the database state is left unchanged.
    *   **Consistency:** Transactions bring the database from one valid state to another. Data written to the database must be valid according to all defined rules, including constraints, cascades, triggers.
    *   **Isolation:** Concurrent execution of transactions results in a system state that would be obtained if transactions were executed serially. One transaction should not be affected by other concurrent transactions.
    *   **Durability:** Once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so, even in the event of power loss, crashes, or errors.
-   **Examples:** PostgreSQL (which we'll focus on), MySQL, Oracle Database, SQL Server, SQLite.

### 2. NoSQL Databases (Non-Relational)

-   "NoSQL" typically means "Not Only SQL." This category encompasses a wide variety of database technologies that were developed in response to the scalability and flexibility demands of modern web applications.
-   **Schema Flexibility:** Often schema-less or have dynamic schemas, allowing for more flexibility in storing varied data structures.
-   **Scalability:** Generally designed to scale out horizontally (distributing data across many servers).
-   **BASE Properties:** Many NoSQL databases prioritize availability and scalability over strict consistency, often described by the BASE acronym:
    *   **Basically Available:** The system guarantees availability.
    *   **Soft state:** The state of the system may change over time, even without input.
    *   **Eventually consistent:** The system will become consistent over time, given that the system doesn't receive input during that time.
-   **Sub-categories of NoSQL Databases:**

    **a) Document Stores:**
    -   *Data Model:* Store data in documents, often using formats like JSON, BSON, or XML. Each document can have its own unique structure.
    -   *Use Cases:* Content management, e-commerce platforms, mobile app data.
    -   *Examples:* MongoDB, Couchbase.
    -   *Pros:* Flexible schema, good for hierarchical data, intuitive for developers working with JSON.
    -   *Cons:* Queries across different document structures can be complex, less mature transaction support compared to SQL.

    **b) Key-Value Stores:**
    -   *Data Model:* Simplest NoSQL type. Data is stored as a collection of key-value pairs. The value can be anything from a simple string or number to a complex object.
    -   *Use Cases:* Caching, session management, user preferences, real-time data.
    -   *Examples:* Redis, Amazon DynamoDB (can also be a document DB), Memcached.
    -   *Pros:* Extremely fast reads and writes, highly scalable, simple model.
    -   *Cons:* Limited query capabilities (usually only by key), not ideal for complex relationships or transactions.

    **c) Graph Databases:**
    -   *Data Model:* Designed to store and navigate relationships. Data is represented as nodes (entities) and edges (relationships between nodes). Both nodes and edges can have properties.
    -   *Use Cases:* Social networks, recommendation engines, fraud detection, knowledge graphs.
    -   *Examples:* Neo4j, Amazon Neptune, JanusGraph.
    -   *Pros:* Excellent for managing and querying highly interconnected data, intuitive for relationship-heavy domains.
    -   *Cons:* Can be less efficient for bulk operations on all entities, specialized query languages (e.g., Cypher for Neo4j).

    **d) Column-Family (Wide-Column) Stores:**
    -   *Data Model:* Store data in tables with rows and columns, but unlike relational databases, the names and format of the columns can vary from row to row in the same table. Optimized for queries over large datasets by column.
    -   *Use Cases:* Big data analytics, logging, time-series data, applications requiring high write throughput.
    -   *Examples:* Apache Cassandra, HBase.
    -   *Pros:* Highly scalable for both reads and writes, good for sparse data.
    -   *Cons:* More complex data modeling than relational DBs, eventual consistency can be a challenge for some applications.

    **e) Vector Databases:**
    -   *Data Model:* Specialized to store, manage, and search high-dimensional vector embeddings. These embeddings are numerical representations of data (text, images, audio, etc.) generated by machine learning models.
    -   *Use Cases:* Semantic search, recommendation systems, anomaly detection, similarity search in AI/ML applications (like our RAG system!).
    -   *Examples:* Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus, Qdrant. PostgreSQL can also function as a vector database using extensions like `pgvector`.
    -   *Pros:* Optimized for fast and efficient similarity searches (Approximate Nearest Neighbor - ANN search), crucial for AI applications.
    -   *Cons:* A relatively newer category, tools and ecosystems are still evolving. Can be specialized, so often used alongside other databases.


## Pros and Cons of SQL vs. NoSQL (General Comparison)

**SQL Databases:**

*   **Pros:**
    *   Strong consistency (ACID).
    *   Mature technology with well-defined standards.
    *   Powerful query language (SQL).
    *   Good for complex queries and relationships.
    *   Robust data integrity features.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Can be harder to scale horizontally.
    *   Schema rigidity can slow down development if requirements change frequently.
    *   Object-Relational Impedance Mismatch (ORM helps, but complexity remains).

**NoSQL Databases:**

*   **Pros:**
    *   High scalability and availability (often designed for horizontal scaling).
    *   Flexible data models (schema-less or dynamic schemas).
    *   Can handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.
    *   Specialized for specific data types/use cases (e.g., key-value, graph).
*   **Cons:**
    *   Eventual consistency (can be an issue for some applications needing strong consistency).
    *   Less mature for complex transactions and joins compared to SQL.
    *   Query capabilities can be limited depending on the type.
    *   Standards and tooling can be more fragmented.

## Introduction to our RAG LLM Chatbot System

For our course project, we're focusing on a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) LLM (Large Language Model) chatbot system.

**High-Level Architecture (Simplified):**

1.  User asks a question to the chatbot (Frontend/Interface).
2.  The question is sent to the backend system (Middleware/API).
3.  The backend system uses the user's question to search a knowledge base for relevant information. This knowledge base is often a collection of documents that have been processed into "chunks" and their corresponding vector embeddings.
4.  The most relevant chunks of information are retrieved (this is the "Retrieval" part).
5.  The original question and the retrieved information are passed as context to an LLM.
6.  The LLM generates an answer based on the provided context (this is the "Generation" part).
7.  The generated answer is sent back to the user.

**Where do databases fit in our RAG system?**

Databases will be crucial for storing and managing various pieces of data:

1.  **Documents:**
    -   Original source documents (e.g., PDFs, text files, web pages).
    -   Metadata about these documents (source, author, date, etc.).
    -   Processed chunks of these documents.
    -   Relational databases are good for structured metadata and relationships. Document content itself could be text.

2.  **Embeddings:**
    -   Vector embeddings for each document chunk. These are high-dimensional vectors that represent the semantic meaning of the text.
    -   This is where Vector Databases (or PostgreSQL with `pgvector`) shine, as they are optimized for similarity searches on these embeddings.

3.  **Chat History:**
    -   Conversations between users and the chatbot for context, personalization, and analytics.
    -   Could be stored in a relational database (structured chat messages) or a document database (more flexible conversation logs).

4.  **User Data:**
    -   User profiles, preferences, authentication information.
    -   Typically well-suited for relational databases.

5.  **System Configuration/Operational Data:**
    -   E.g., versions of embedding models used, system logs.


**Initial thoughts on what kind of data our RAG system will need:**

-   `documents` table: To store information about the source documents.
-   `chunks` table: To store the processed text chunks from documents.
-   `embeddings` table: To store the vector embeddings for each chunk and link them.
-   `users` table: To manage user information (if we add user accounts).
-   `chat_sessions` table: To group messages into conversations.
-   `chat_messages` table: To store individual messages from users and the bot.

We will primarily use PostgreSQL for its versatility, ability to handle relational data, JSONB for semi-structured metadata, and the `pgvector` extension for vector embeddings. This allows us to manage most of our RAG system's data needs within a single, robust database system, at least for the scope of this course. We will also briefly explore other NoSQL options for complementary roles.
