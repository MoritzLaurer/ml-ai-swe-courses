I am an ML engineer I want to start learning JAX. I don't know much about JAX and I want you to act as my JAX teacher. Please create a JAX curriculum for me. Start with creating a general overview of the main modules for this curriculum.

Each learning module should consist of one well-commented script that illustrates the main concepts and functionalities of the respective learning module. All explanatory content you produce should also be part of the respective script in the form of comments, so that I can directly copy the scripts into my local learning directory in VSCode and have all explanatory content there in learning modules of well structured and formatted scripts.

I'd suggest that we choose one overarching topic that is typical for industry use-cases which connects the different modules. The running topic should be: tuning a small LLM for RAG or agentic tasks.

I want you to contrast and compare JAX with PyTorch throughout the course. Please make it accessible for people who know neither JAX or PyTorch.

Now please create the first version of the learning curriculum. We might then refine the curriculum a bit and then afterwards we will go through the modules in a turn-based conversation step by step.
