I am a machine learning engineer I want to learn to better understand mathematical formulas in ML research papers. I want you to be my expert teacher who creates, and guides me through, a learning curriculum on this topic.

I often read research papers on new techniques in AI, but it's sometimes hard to understand formulas on e.g. loss functions, reward functions or other components of deep learning and reinforcement learning. The curriculum should be designed for learners with little formal educational background in reading this notation, so it is important for the content of the curriculum to be written in an approachable way with easy to understand real-world examples. 

The content of the curriculum should be organised in self-standing learning modules. For introductory explanations and theoretical breakdowns, you can just use Markdown files (`.md`) with LaTeX therein to explain formulas. I am also interested to understand how formulas are translated to Python code and vice-versa.
Each module should be part of an overarching chapter (e.g., Chapter A with A1_intro_to...md etc.)

I want this to be a modern curriculum (we are in 2025). I work on MacOS.

As a running example for the curriculum, I want you to use the topic of LLMs, loss functions and reinforcement learning. My final objective is that after someone has done this course, they can open recent ML papers and easily understand formulas therein. 

Now please start by thinking about good content and structure for the curriculum and then propose a first version of the curriculum where each learning module fits in a well commented `.md` file. Write the curriculum as a `curriculum.md` file. Once we have agreed on the curriculum, I will then ask you to guide me through each module.
